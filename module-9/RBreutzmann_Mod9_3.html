        Write at least three paragraphs; either a short story about you, or a poem, or movie dialog.. etc.
        
        For your reading pleasure, I used the prologue of the story I've been working on off and on for the last 2 years.  It's set in the fantasy world I made that I run my D&D campaigns in.  :)

        Place four <span> tags containing a blank line (underscores) for four words. 
        word1 = Elara
        word2 = Havenshire
        word3 = Ethal
        word4 = accomplice

        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <h3>Trial Chambers of <span class="word2">__________</span></h3>
        
        <p><strong>“Guilty.”</strong></p>
        
        <p>The word echoed through <span class="word1">_____</span>’s mind.</p>
        
        <p>
            Sound returned slowly. The scrape of boots against stone. The murmur of voices.
            The heavy doors of the chamber opening and closing. She remembered her parents
            being led away in irons. Her brother followed. She did not recall whether he looked back.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            She remained where she stood, facing the magistrate who had just unmade her world.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <span class=word1>_____</span> Greenbottle,” he said, studying her with measured regard. “You present a
            difficult matter. At sixteen, the laws of <span class="word3">____</span> do not permit us to charge you with
            the crimes of your parents. Yet the Halflings of <span class="word2">__________</span> recognize sixteen as
            the age of adulthood. That renders you ineligible for state stewardship, which
            would otherwise be customary.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            His words passed over her like distant thunder.
        </p>
        
        <p><em>Just finish it</em>, she thought. <em>Pass sentence and be done.</em></p>
        
        <p>
            “The nature of your involvement is also minor,” the magistrate continued. “You
            did not steal. You sang. You held the crowd while others relieved them of their
            purses. The coin placed in your hand was given freely, even if the performance
            itself was part of deception.”
        </p>
        
        <p>She lowered her gaze.</p>
        
        <p>
            She had never cut a purse or slipped a ring from a careless finger. She had only
            lifted her voice and watched the crowd gather. Watched them smile. Watched them
            grow careless. She enjoyed it when all eyes were on her. However, she knew all
            too well what that made her: an <span class="word4">__________</span>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            “Therefore,” the magistrate said, “I am prepared to offer you a choice. You may
            serve your sentence alongside your family. Or you may accept a pardon and be
            released to make your own way.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Released. The word felt hollow. Released to what?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            They had never remained anywhere long enough to plant roots. Friends were a risk.
            Neighbors, a liability. There was no house waiting for her return. No aunt or
            cousin to take her in. No savings tucked away for a future they had never planned.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            “How am I to survive?” she asked at last. “With no coin. No family. No home.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            “It will not be easy,” the magistrate replied. “But if you choose imprisonment,
            you will bear the mark of criminality for the remainder of your life.” His
            expression shifted, almost imperceptibly. “You possess a genuine gift. And among
            your people, sixteen is the age of adulthood.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>Among your people.</em> He spoke the words without malice, yet they carried
            a certain ignorance.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>We do not cast our children out at sixteen</em>, she thought. <em>We mark the
                passing of childhood. That is not the same as severing blood.</em> Still, a criminal
            for life, or alone in a land that had never been hers.
        </p>
        
        <p>“How long?” she asked.</p>
        
        <p>
            “Until the end of the day,” he said. The softness had left his voice. “If you do
            not choose, the court will choose for you.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The chamber seemed larger than before. Colder.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            She did not know which fate frightened her more. A cell beside her family. Or a
            road with no destination and no one telling her where to go.
        </p>
