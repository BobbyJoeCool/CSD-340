    CSD 340 - Web Development with HTML and CSS
    Assignment 2.2
    Due Date: January 18th, 2026

    Assignment Instructions Step 1 - HTML File

        Create a new directory under your local csd-340 folder (repository) and name it module-2
        Create a new HTML document and name it <LastName_Mod2_2>.html and add it to your module-2 directory
        Create a new CSS document and name it <LastName_Mod2_2>.css and add it to your module-2 directory
        Using what we learned from Module 1, build a new HTML page, add your name and assignment number (documentation) and make sure it validates with 0 errors. 
        
        Contents of <LastName_Mod2_2>.html
            In the <head> of the HTML document add four (4) meta tags 
                Hint: see pages 191-192 for help on what I am expecting
            In the <head> of the HTML document add a link to <yourLastName_mod.2_2>.css
                Hint: for help with linking CSS files, refer to page 236 of the course’s textbook 
            Give the HTML document a title of “CSD 340 Development with HTML and CSS” 
                Hint: this goes in the <title></title> element
            In the body of the HTML document add a <div> and give it an ID of “container” 
                <div id=”container”>
            For the remaining HTML sections, we will be adding paragraphs of text and formatting to resemble creating a page from a book
                Add an h1 tag and with the following text: “Assignment 2.2 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2”
                Add an h2 tag and give this header a chapter title 
                Write four (4) paragraphs, each with at least three sentences, that provide an introduction to you. You might describe your hometown, childhood, hobbies, family, etc.
                Wrap each paragraph in <p> tags 
                Give the first paragraph a CSS class of “intro”
                Pick a single sentence in any of the paragraphs and apply a CSS class of “sentence” to it
                    Hint: use the <span></span> element and give the span element a CSS class of sentence
                Underneath the paragraphs add a horizontal line 
                    Hint: use the <hr /> element 
                Underneath the horizontal line, add Bellevue University's full address (street, city, state, and zip) and a URL to their website
                    Have the address sit below the horizontal line
                        Hint: use the <address></address> element
                    Put each part of the address on its own line, as you would address an envelope you mail (use the paragraph tag)
                        First line: Bellevue University (website link)
                        Second line: street address
                        Third line: city, state, zip
