<!--
    - Create a new folder under your local csd-340 folder (repository) and name it module-8
    - Make a copy of LastName_Mod6_2.html and add it to your module-8 directory. Rename the file to LastName_Mod8_2.html.
    - Make a copy of LastName_Mod6_2.css and add it to your module-8 directory. Rename the file to LastName_Mod8_2.css.
    - Copy the card, card-title, card-content classes from LastName_Mod6_2.css to this file
    - Add a link in the index.html file to the current HTML file
        - Hint: Refer back to assignment 4.2 if you are confused on what this item is referencing
    - Contents of LastName_Mod8_2.html
        - Add a link to LastName_Mod8_2.css file in the HTML documents element
        - Make sure HTML page title says “CSD 340 Web Development with HTML and CSS”
        - Rename the h1 text value to “Assignment 8.2: Build a Web Page - Part 6”
        - Add a new card, card-title, and card-content divs above the Favorite Foods list div
            - Hint: Use a main div for the card class, then two nested divs for card-title and card-content. You are basically following the same format you used in the Foods listing.
            - Give the card title a value of “Top 5 Favorite Movies”
            - In the card content, create a table with two columns. First column has a header of "Movie Name", second column has a header of "Two Characters".
            - In the second column for each movie, create an unordered list of two characters from the movie listed in column one.
        - Add two HTML line breaks between the two cards
        - The second card div can be copied from the last assignment for favorite foods.
        - Modify the footer to add a copyright year and your last name aligned to the left.
