    Using the below starter code, create a basic HTML page and add the code to your <yourLastName_Mod1_3>.html document
    Visit the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) website and validate the markup you wrote using their HTML validator
        Hint: select the “Validate by Direct Input” link and paste the markup you wrote into the “Validate by direct input” field
        https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
    Take a screenshot of the validators results (there should be one or more errors)
    Correct the identified errors

        Hint: update the text in the <title> element of the page <head>
