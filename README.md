**Discussion Question: 100 Things**

Using the ***100 Things Every Designer Should Know About People*** reading assignment, select two (2) of the "things" you read about, include the number and title of the "thing" (i.e. #36 Time is Relative), and then do two embellishments, one embellishment and one visual example, or two visual examples.

1) **Embellish:** Tell us something that the reading did not tell us on that specific "thing" or embellish on what was presented. Be sure you are adding meaningful content to the conversation and not just making noise. Your addition can be a link to an article, or you can write out your embellishment.

#### Assignments

##### Assignment 3.2: GitHub Pages

Before you start this assignment, you should know you'll be joining millions of others in presenting a portal/landing page available to anyone who has the URL. In case you did not know, every single web site on the internet has a default index.html file loaded in the root directory of web pages. When the internet was built it was decided that instead of having users type in index.html after every domain name; www.bellevue.edu/index.html, or www.cnn.com/index.html... when a connection is made to a web site without specifying a specific file in the URL, servers return a default page: index.html.

If you look at your .html files in github, all you can see is the code itself, not how it should be interpreted as a web page.

So... you'll need that index.html to reside in the root of your CSD340 directory, then create a 'Pages' site as directed. The result will be a github URL with io in the URL, which will act as as webpage. All your assignments will be linked from that index.html, and voila! You have a portal/landing page..

In this assignment, you will be adding a landing page to the course's GitHub repository and publishing the content to GitHub 'Pages'. Before you attempt this assignment, please make sure you have completed the 'Reading Assignments' section of this module.

To be clear, the outcome of this assignment is a landing page for your csd-340 GitHub repository. The links in this landing page will link to your completed assignments and upcoming projects.

**Assignment Instructions**
- Add a new file to your csd-340 repository and name it index.html (must be named exactly)
    - Hint: this file will be at the root of your csd-340 directory (do not add this to a module folder)
- Add a new file to your csd-340 repository and name it site.css
- Contents of index.html
    - Create an empty HTML document (follow the code you used in Module 2), add your name and assignment number (documentation).
    - Give the HTML document a title of
    - \<your first name\> \<your last name\>
    - CSD 340 Landing Page
        - Example: Johann Bach's CSD 340 Landing Page
    - Add a link to site.css file in the HTML documents head element
    - Add a main div to the body of the HTML document with an id of container
    - # container
        - Add an h1 tag and give it a text value of
        -\<your first name\> \<your last name\>
        - CSD 340 Landing Page
            - Example: Johann Bach's CSD 340 Landing Page

        - Add an HTML horizontal line
        - Add an h3 tag and give it a text value of Module Assignments
        - Underneath the h3 tag add an unordered list with list items for assignments 1.3, 2.2, and 3.3, you'll be updating this as we go along.
            - Each list item will need an anchor tag that links to the HTML file you completed for the assignment, think relative links
            - Example: \<a href="module-2/Sampson_Mod1_3"\>Assignment 1.3\>\</a\>
        - Add an h3 tag and give it a text value of Projects
        - Underneath the projects h3 tag add an unordered list with list items for bioSite Project Home Page. You'll be creating the files for this later in the course.

                - \<a href=""\>bioSite Project Home Page\</a\>
        - Add an h4 tag and give it a text value of Important Links
        - Underneath the important links h4 tag add an unordered list with list items for
