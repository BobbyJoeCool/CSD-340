**Discussion Question: 100 Things**

Using the ***100 Things Every Designer Should Know About People*** reading assignment, select two (2) of the "things" you read about, include the number and title of the "thing" (i.e. #36 Time is Relative), and then do two embellishments, one embellishment and one visual example, or two visual examples.

1) **Embellish:** Tell us something that the reading did not tell us on that specific "thing" or embellish on what was presented. Be sure you are adding meaningful content to the conversation and not just making noise. Your addition can be a link to an article, or you can write out your embellishment.
1) **Visual Example:** Provide us with a graphic example that is relevant to web design. This can be something you create or something you find. Again, be sure to add meaningful content to the conversation.

##### Assignment 1.3: Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 1

Before we delve too deep into the world of HTML development, we must first understand the core principles governing how HTML documents are formatted and structured. Every website page needs a specific structure in order to function properly in a browser. For this assignment, you will learn how to create and validate HTML documents.

- Correct the identified errors
- Re-validate the HTML code:
    - Hint: Paste the updated HTML code into the validator again
- Take a screenshot of the updated results (this time, there should be 0 errors)
- Add a single \<h1\> element underneath the \<body\> element with the following text: “Assignment 1.3 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 1”
- Add a sentence under the \<h1\> that describes your location and today’s weather. Include the degree symbol (use HTML or keyboard input)

- Take a screenshot of the updated results (this time, there should be 0 errors)
- Open the file in your computer's default browser and take a screenshot of the web page
- Combine all images into a single Word document and include your name, date, and assignment number. Name the file -.docx

**Starter Code**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
